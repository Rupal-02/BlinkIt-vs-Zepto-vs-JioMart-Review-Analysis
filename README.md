## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves determining the emotional tone of a piece of text. This project applies sentiment analysis to e-commerce reviews, aiming to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate a practical application of deep learning, specifically LSTM models, for sentiment classification in the context of e-commerce reviews. The project uses reviews from Blinkit, Zepto, and Jiomart to train and evaluate the LSTM model.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project consists of e-commerce reviews collected from publicly available sources. The reviews are labeled with their corresponding sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). The dataset is organized into separate files for Blinkit, Zepto, and Jiomart reviews.

## Methodology

The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

### Data Loading

* The dataset is loaded into the Colab environment using the `pandas` library.
* The reviews and sentiment labels are extracted from the dataset.

### Preprocessing

* The text data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise, such as punctuation and special characters.
* The reviews are tokenized into individual words.
* Word embeddings are used to represent the words numerically.

### Model Building

* An LSTM model is constructed using the `keras` library.
* The model architecture includes an embedding layer, LSTM layers, and dense layers.

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Model: A Concise Explanation
*LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs in learning long-term dependencies in sequential data.
*Key Feature: Memory Cells

*The core of an LSTM is the memory cell, which stores information over time. It has three gates:

*Forget Gate: Decides what information to discard from the cell.
*Input Gate: Decides what new information to store in the cell.
*Output Gate: Decides what part of the cell's state to output.

*How LSTMs Work:
The input sequence is processed step-by-step.
At each step, the LSTM cell uses its gates to update its state based on the current input and previous state.
This process continues until the entire sequence is processed.
The final output can be used for tasks like sentiment analysis.

*Why LSTMs are Good for Sentiment Analysis:
Sentiment analysis needs to consider relationships between words across a whole text. LSTMs excel at capturing these long-term dependencies, making them well-suited for this task.
*In Essence:
Think of LSTMs as having a memory that selectively stores and forgets information, helping them understand the overall sentiment of a text, like a review.

### Training and Evaluation

* The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset using an appropriate optimizer and loss function.
* The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Prediction

* The trained model is used to predict the sentiment of new, unseen reviews.
* The predictions are presented with their corresponding confidence scores.

## Results

The project's results show the effectiveness of the LSTM model in classifying e-commerce reviews with reasonable accuracy. The specific results, including the achieved accuracy, precision, and recall, are presented in the notebook.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the viability of using deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis in the e-commerce domain. The LSTM model proves to be a valuable tool for understanding customer opinions and sentiment towards Blinkit, Zepto, and Jiomart.
